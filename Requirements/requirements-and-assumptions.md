# Requirements
Requirements are numbered. Functional begin with A, non-functional (qualitative) with Q. Some are based on Assumptions.
## Functional Requirements

A1. The system must allow candidates to create and manage their professional profiles
A2. The system must automatically anonymize candidate profiles by removing PII
A3. The system must provide AI-powered matching between job postings and candidate profiles
A4. Employers must be able to post and manage job listings
A5. The system must support reveal requests from employers to view candidate PII
A6. The system must integrate with external HR systems and job boards
A7. The system must provide skills assessment capabilities
A8. The system must include bias detection for job postings
A9. Candidates must be able to control their privacy settings
A10. The system must generate skill graphs for improved matching

## Non-Functional Requirements

Q1. Performance

- Profile updates must be reflected immediately
- System must support at least 1000 concurrent users

Q2. Interoperability 
- Must support standard HR system integration protocols
- Must provide REST APIs for external system integration
- Must support common data exchange formats

Q3. Availability
