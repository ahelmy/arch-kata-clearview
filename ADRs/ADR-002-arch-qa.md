# ADR-002: Architecture Quality Attributes

## Date:
2024-11-25

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
We need to choose the quality attributes that will guide the architecture.

## Decision:
We will use the following quality attributes:
- Performance
- Interoperability
- Availability
- Data Integrity
- Feasibility
- Security
The following table describes each quality attribute and why it was chosen:

| Quality Attribute | Description | Why Chosen |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Performance | Quick response times for searches, matching, and profile management | Users expect responsive experience when searching candidates or applying for positions. The AI-powered matching and anonymization processes must complete quickly to maintain user engagement. |
| Interoperability | Ability to integrate with external HR systems, job boards, and other platforms | The platform needs to seamlessly connect with existing employer HR systems, job boards, and other recruitment platforms to provide a comprehensive solution. This enables efficient data exchange and workflow integration. |
| Availability | System must be consistently available and perform matching operations accurately | As a critical HR platform, downtime could significantly impact hiring processes and user trust. High availability ensures employers and candidates can access the system when needed. |
| Data Integrity | Ensuring accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle | Critical for maintaining anonymized profiles and preventing unauthorized PII exposure. Data integrity ensures that the matching process remains objective and that sensitive information is properly handled. |
| Feasibility | The system must be feasible to implement and maintain | Given the complex requirements around AI matching and anonymization, the architecture must be practical to build and evolve over time while managing costs and technical complexity. |
| Security | Protection of sensitive user data, including PII, and secure access control | Essential since the platform handles confidential candidate information that must be protected. Security ensures PII is only revealed at appropriate stages and that all data access is properly authorized. |


## Consequences:
- High availability and performance requirements may increase infrastructure costs
- Security and data integrity needs add complexity to development and testing
- Interoperability requirements necessitate building and maintaining multiple integrations
- Balancing feasibility with other attributes may require trade-offs in feature implementation
- Additional effort required to properly test and validate all quality attributes
- Increased development time to properly implement security and data integrity controls
- Higher infrastructure costs to meet performance and availability targets
- More complex testing requirements to verify quality attributes are met
- Need for specialized expertise in areas like security and integration
- Potential limitations on feature scope to maintain feasibility
